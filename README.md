# Project Title - just trying new things out

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Dont have the code yet but i have an idea
CNN model that learns form users input and can decisions based on your previos interactions 
imagine returning boss in game in the begining he is waek and he doesnt know you, in the middle of the game its stornger cuz he learned few of your trick and at the endgame he reading you like a book so you need to outsmart him with random activities so he wouldnt recognize your patterns


## Background

this is just nice to have thing

it doesnt solve any of the problems in like real world for nowm


## How is it used?

you implement some kind of general model that tracks 3-4 last player actions (move, jump, attack, attack) so model will learn that after "move,jump,atck next thing is atck so it can give the output to the enemy to move or dodge and so on 

This is how you create code examples but i dont have the code:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
dont gave any

## Challenges

it needs to be aplicable to general code in gaming like c# and i dont know how to do that 
## What next?

making my model for this and making my first game
